            My Computer Science teacher gave me some very difficult question on the latest assignments. They had to do with numbers, and as I looked further and further the more I was dragged into dead ends.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Let me first ask a question. What is mathematics? Just like biology is the study of life and chemistry is the study of matter, some call mathematics the study of numbers.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I find that notion slightly unnerving because while everything in math points back to numbers in one way or another, there are some realms like complex numbers that isn't even real.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            You would be correct to say that they're a number, but be honest, are we studying complex numbers for the sake of numbers? If mathematics was the study of numbers we would be stuck at number theory.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Biology and chemistry are defined as such because life and matter are things whose actual significance go beyond their definition. Biology goes from large-scale ecological changes down to the tinest microscopic molecular interactions. Chemistry is just crazy because who knows what molecules can form and what properties they have?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I think mathematics is the study of patterns, and numbers is one of the ways we represent patterns. We study complex numbers not because it was a nice idea to define the imaginary unit, but because the imaginary unit can lead to principled mathematical structures. "Division by zero" never got the same treatment because defining such a unit yields no pattern. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The same can be said for applied mathematics. We're using math to generalize the real world into greater patterns. This definition of mathematics goes beyond its definition. It's everywhere.

            When I get stuck on dead ends, I have to remind myself again and again that <span class="font-bold">chaos is order in disguise</span>. All these numbers over the bash console screen mean something. When I study the role of the activated Cytochrome b6f complex in ETC, I can't predict how a living population may change over a decade.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Sometimes I need to take a step back and look at the big picture. Sometimes the big picture is chaotic and I have to zoom in instead. Regardless, I have to remind myself that chaos does not exist for no reason, and patterns do not exist for no reason either. Together, they form your reality.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I say this because I am never in a state of absolute order nor chaos. That weird mix of order and chaos cascading in and out of focus hides the truth. I'm not who I want to be. I don't know what's going to happen... uncertainty is a blessing. <span class="font-bold">Don't be scared of it, be aware of it</span>.

            Something is waiting for you.
