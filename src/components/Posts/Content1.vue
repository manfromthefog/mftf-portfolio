            Seriously.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            What the hell happened to our childhoods?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I get it. You're not in the mood, but I want to talk about this. I stayed up late and suddenly realized tomorrow's my 18th birthday, and I also realized that these 18 years are never coming back.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I went trick or treating for the very last time. I played parachute for the very last time. Ran around school, played tag for the very last time. Enjoyed freezies and woke up to the promise of magic and presents for the very last time.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Do I remember? Yes, I do. The brighter days. When the world felt new; when everything had more color and more magic. When Christmas still feeled like Christmas. When a new day meant something new.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Rather, I should ask, do you feel it? Because each new day is feeling increasing similar. The magic is seemingly in the past.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I have intense nostalgia for a time before I were even born. Is it curiosity for what happened back then? Or has the world truly changed?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            My time, just like the ones before, is decreasing. I can't go back. Something feels off. It's not like that grade 6 birthday party when I was screaming in joy. As stupid as it seems, I was a kid, and everything was fine.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The clock hits 12pm. Since I was not in Canada, I sufficiently exercised my rights to consume alcohol in a celebratory manner. I was still and silent.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            But even alcohol can't change my realization, that there are some things we wish for but can never have.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Now I'm an adult. In theory I am more free than I have ever been, but in reality I know that I'm a prisoner to time. The world has never been the same. Vacations don't feel the same. Going out with friends. It's as if the excitement of the world is fading, being drained and stored permanently into a past reality I can never access.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Against my wishes the date is August 4, 2025. I didn't ask for this, and I'm not asking to escape death.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I just wish I had a chance to cherish those years again.
