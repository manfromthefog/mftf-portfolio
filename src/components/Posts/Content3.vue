            I am a person who tends to fluctuate greatly between hope and doubt. Let me tell you an interesting story. I woke up on the morning of March 29, 2024 especially early because that was the day UPenn decisions went out. I even bookmarked the tab - and I was rejected.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I mean, of course I would be rejected. I didn't even take the SAT. However, that instant before my brain was able to comprehend what the signals from my eyes meant, I had hope. A slight sliver of hope that I would be admitted to UPenn.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I knew that my chances were decreasing day by day. I applied to some of the most competitive programs in North America, and thus far I have been admitted to none of them. Of course, I had backups, but my ego wouldn't allow that.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Hope is something I yearn for, but also something I consciously contain. I fear that holding excessive hope spirals my mind into delusion. I fear that hope will lead to far more devastating receptions of failure.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            At the same time hope is what keeps me going. The concept behind hope is often simple. A single existential notion of "what if?"
        </p><br>
        <p>
            "What if I get admitted to UWaterloo?" How ironic that such hopeful notions arise immediately after my rejection! Still in the aftercast of my failures, I was quick to deny myself. I've only been coding for two years. I had weak fundamentals and was unfamiliar with backend.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I went to delete the UPenn emails from my inbox, and I was blasted with "An Offer of Admission From the University of Waterloo."
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I mean, isn't that what I do? In grade 9 I feared university wouldn't even be an option due to how bad my grades were. In elementary school I was not some genius, rather "mentally disabled." Somehow I'm here, and I believe through all these years of fighting my way upstream, miracles will happen again.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            After the excitement has worn off I began to wonder why I was even admitted. Was it luck? Suddenly, the countless nights I spent pulling myself up seemed to tell me "no, you earned it."
        </p><br>
        <p>
            There's a lot going on every single day. Every single day we are blasted with information. Charlie Kirk headlines, rumors of war, and things that I cannot help but notice. It's chaos, and I have to remind myself time and time again that probability is random, but results are definite.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            In other words, regardless of what you fear might happen, know that there is only one result. After the result arrives, you will see all the ways in which it was not random, because you are the sum of your choices.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            "Will I get a co-op?" Maybe, maybe not. Either way I'm still myself, and nothing can change me.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            It's 2035. I'm 28 years old, in a house I bought in 2030 using some money I made in 2028. Beside me is a person I met in 2027. In 2026 I failed my finals. In 2025 I didn't get a co-op. In 2024 I got rejected from UPenn.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The sun is shining, and the weather is great. I'm exactly where I want to be. Looking back, everything I did led me exactly to this moment in 2035.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            To my present self: <br>
            The future is not  <span class="italic">your</span> destiny. This too, will pass.
